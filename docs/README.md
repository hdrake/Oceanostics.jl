# Documentation

All files for the docs are here. Docs are built using
[Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/) and a quick intro to how to build them can
be found [here](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/guide/).

As per `make.jl`, docs are deployed to the `gh-pages` of this repo.
