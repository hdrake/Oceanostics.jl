# Oceanostics

Oceanostics is a Julia package created to facilitate getting diagnostics quantities in
[Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) simulations. It was created solely as a
companion package to [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl), so we refer users
first to the [Oceananigans documentation](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/)
before getting started with Oceanostics.
